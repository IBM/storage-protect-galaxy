**_2.1.1 Hardware requirements_**

You must acquire hardware that is based on scale size requirements. You can choose equivalent or better components than what are listed.

The following topics list the hardware requirements for a medium configuration. The tables contain detailed descriptions, including part numbers and quantities for IBM® components that are used in the storage configuration blueprints.

The system memory sizes that are provided are recommendations for optimal performance. They are not minimum requirements. Memory recommendations account for using both data deduplication and node replication with a database that is near maximum capacity. Some workloads can tolerate smaller amounts of memory. When node replication is not used, the memory recommendations can be reduced by 25%.

The hardware specifications that are provided are current at the time of publishing. Part substitutions might be required, depending on hardware availability over time. Be cautious if you plan to substitute a smaller quantity of larger drives, particularly for the database. A smaller quantity of drives might not provide comparable performance.

IBM FlashSystem C200 systems provide a straightforward, dependable flash platform for managing block-based storage. Their ease of deployment, enterprise data services, and consistent flash performance make them well suited for hosting both the IBM Storage Protect server database and its storage pools. For additional details about the capabilities of the FlashSystem C200 and the broader FlashSystem portfolio, refer to the IBM Flash Storage family documentation.

Recent IBM Storage Protect releases introduce new capabilities for moving or copying data to tape storage. If you are planning to include the optional features of tiering to tape, making retention set copies to tape, or copying the container pool to tape, you will need to increase the number of fibre channel ports in the configuration. Consider the following:

* Fibre channel traffic for disk access and tape access should be zoned to different fibre channel ports rather than sharing ports.
* The data being moved or copied to tape is reconstructed and uncompressed to its original size before being transferred to tape. For this reason, more fibre channel port capacity is needed for the tape access than the disk access. For a system which requires a single port for disk access, at least two additional ports dedicated for tape access will be required. For a system which requires two ports for disk access, at least four additional ports are required for tape access.

The tables in the following topics have abbreviated part lists, which include only major components. Work with your hardware supplier to ensure that your configuration is complete.
