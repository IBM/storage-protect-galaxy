## Chapter 6. Completing the system configuration

### 6.1 Changing default passwords

Beginning with v5.x, the blueprint scripts no longer allow the use of a default password. The user is required to provide a password during the configuration in response to prompts when running interactively, or in the response files when running non-interactively.

**About this task**

The script sets as specified by the user for the following passwords:
* Initial IBM Storage Protect administrator
* IBM Storage Protect server
* Db2 instance owner

**Procedure**

* To update password information for the server and administrator, use server commands. </br>For more information, see the **SET SERVERPASSWORD**, **UPDATE ADMIN**, and **UPDATE SERVER** server commands.
* To update the password for the Db2 instance owner, use the RHEL Linux operating system `passwd` command.
* Create a system-level administrator. Then, remove or lock the administrator that is named ADMIN by using the **REMOVE ADMIN** or **LOCK ADMIN** command.
* Change the password that is used to protect the server encryption key for database backup operations. </br>Issue the following command:
  ```
   set dbrecovery dbback_filedev password= <newpassword>
  ```
  where _newpassword_ is the password that you set. </br>
  **Attention**: You must remember the password, or you will be unable to restore database backups.
