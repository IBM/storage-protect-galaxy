### What's new in Version 5.1.1

The IBM Storage Protect Blueprint configuration scripts, hardware and software requirements, and documentation are updated.
* **Updated the Storage Protect references for IBM Flash C200 storage on Linux..** </br>
  The `medium` storage references have been updated to the IBM FlashSystem C200 which provide a scalable all-flash storage solution that is fast, affordable, and reliable.

* **The blueprint configuration automation no longer provides default passwords** </br>
  The default values for passwords set during server configuration have been eliminated to improve security. The user is now required to provide values for all passwords set during the initial configuration. In addition, the blueprint configuration automation now enforces the new minimum password length of 15 characters introduced in IBM Storage Protect 8.1.16.
