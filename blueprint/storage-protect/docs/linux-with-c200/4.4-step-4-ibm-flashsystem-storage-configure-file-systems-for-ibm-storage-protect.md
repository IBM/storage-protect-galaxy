### Step 4: IBM FlashSystem C200 storage – configure file systems for IBM Storage Protect

After the FlashSystem C200 LUNs are visible through multipath, create file systems and mount them for the database, logs and storage pool.

**Procedure**

1. **Identify devices** 
   * Use `multipath -ll` or `lsblk` to determine the device names assigned to each LUN.

2. **Create XFS file systems** 
   * Run `mkfs.xfs` on each device.  
   * Use the `-L` option to assign a volume label that matches the intended mount point (for example, `-L TSMdbspace00`).

3. **Create mount points** 
   * Create directories such as `/tsminst1/TSMdbspace00`, `/tsminst1/TSMalog`, `/tsminst1/TSMfile00` and so on.

4. **Update `/etc/fstab`** 
   * Add entries for each device using its label.  
   * Use mount options `defaults,noatime,inode64` for database and log file systems and `defaults,noatime,inode64,nobarrier` for storage pool file systems.

5. **Mount the file systems** 
   * Run `mount -a` to mount all file systems.  
   * Verify that the correct capacity is available and that the file systems are owned by the instance owner (for example, `tsmuser`).
