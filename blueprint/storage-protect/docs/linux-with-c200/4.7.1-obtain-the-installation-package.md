### Step 8: Install the IBM Storage Protect server

#### Obtain the installation package

You can obtain the IBM Storage Protect installation package from an IBM download site such as Passport Advantage or IBM Fix Central.

**Before you begin**

To ensure that the files can be downloaded correctly, set the system user limit for maximum file size to unlimited:

1. To query the maximum file size value, issue the following command:
   ```
    ulimit -Hf
   ```
1. If the system user limit for maximum file size is not set to unlimited, change it to unlimited by following the instructions in the RHEL 9 documentation.

**Procedure**

1. Download the server installation package from [Passport Advantage](http://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage) or [Fix Central](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral).
1. For the latest information, updates, and maintenance fixes, go to the [IBM Support Portal](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport).
1. Complete the following steps:
1. Verify that you have enough space to store the installation files when they are extracted from the product package. See the download document for the space requirements:
   - IBM Storage Protect 8.1.27: [technote 4042992](https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042992)
1. Download the package to the directory of your choice. The path must contain no more than 128 characters. Be sure to extract the installation files to an empty directory. Do not extract the files to a directory that contains previously extracted files, or any other files.
1. Ensure that executable permission is set for the package. If necessary, change the file permissions by issuing the following command:
   ```
   chmod a+x package_name
   ```
   where _package_name_ is the name of the downloaded package, for example:
   ```
    8.1.27.000-IBM-SPSRV-Linux.bin
   ```
1. Extract the file from the package by issuing the following command:
   ```
   ./package_name
   ```
   where _package_name_ is the name of the package.
