### Configure a file system by using the manual procedure

If you choose not to use the script, you can create the file systems manually:

1. Identify the devices for each LUN using `multipath -ll`.  Record which devices correspond to the database, log, backup and file pool volumes.
2. Create a GPT partition table on each device using `parted` or `gdisk`.  Create one primary partition that spans the entire device.
3. Format the partitions with XFS:
   ```
   mkfs.xfs -f -L TSMdbspace00 /dev/mapper/db_lun00p1
   ```
4. Create mount point directories (for example, `/tsminst1/TSMdbspace00`) and set ownership to the instance owner.
5. Add entries to `/etc/fstab` using labels rather than device names to ensure consistent mounting.  Use the mount options described in Step 4.
6. Mount the file systems with `mount -a` and verify using `df -h`.

The manual procedure gives you fine control over each step but requires more time and attention to detail than the automated script.
