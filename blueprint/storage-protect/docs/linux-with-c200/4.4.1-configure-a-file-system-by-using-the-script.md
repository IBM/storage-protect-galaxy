### Configure a file system by using the script

The blueprint includes a Perl script, `sp_config.pl`, that automates the creation of file systems and server configuration.  To use the script for a medium FlashSystem C200 deployment:

1. Copy the `config-medium.yaml` sample from the blueprint package to a working directory.
2. Edit the YAML file to specify your device names, mount points, server instance name, administrator passwords and network settings.
3. Run the script as root:
   ```
   perl sp_config.pl --mode prepare --config config-medium.yaml
   ```
   The `prepare` mode partitions the LUNs, formats them as XFS, and updates `/etc/fstab`.  It also creates the response file for the server configuration.
4. After verifying that the file systems are mounted correctly, run the `configure` mode to configure the IBM Storage Protect server:
   ```
   perl sp_config.pl --mode configure --config config-medium.yaml
   ```
5. The script logs its actions to `/var/log/sp_config.log`.  Review the log for errors and correct any issues before proceeding.
