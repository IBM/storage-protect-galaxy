## Chapter 2. Implementation requirements

### 2.2 Planning worksheets

Use the planning worksheets to record values that you use when you complete the steps to setup your system and then configure the IBM Storage Protect server. The preferred method is to use the default values that are listed in the worksheets.

Default values in the following tables correspond to the default values that are used by the Blueprint configuration script to configure the server. By using these values to create your file systems and directories, you can accept all defaults for the configuration when you run the script. If you create directories or plan to use values that do not match the defaults, you must manually enter those values for the configuration.

#### 2.2.1 Planning worksheets for IBM FlashSystem C200 configurations
Use Table 6 to plan for the file systems and directories that you create during system setup. All directories that you create for the server must be empty.

_Table 6. Values needed for preconfiguration_

| Item      | Default value    | Your value  | Directory size  | Notes          |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| TCP/IP port address for communications with the server | 1500 |  | Not applicable | This value is used when you install and configure the operating system and is assigned by the Blueprint configuration script during configuration of the server. </br> If you want to use a value other than the default, you can specify a number in the range 1024 - 32767. |
| Directory for the server instance | /home/tsminst1/tsminst1 |  | 100 GB | If you change the value for the server instance directory from the default, modify the IBM Db2® instance owner ID in Table 7 as well. | 
| Directory for server installation | <ul><li>/</li><li>/usr</li><li>/var</li><li>/tmp</li><li>/opt</li></ul> |  | <ul><li>/ &emsp; 5 GB</li><li>/usr &emsp; 5 GB</li><li>/var &emsp; 5 GB</li><li>/tmp &emsp; 5 GB</li><li>/opt &emsp; 10 GB</li></ul> | The directory size values are the minimum available space that you must have for each directory. |

| Directories for storage | /tsminst1/TSMfile00 </br> /tsminst1/TSMfile01 </br> /tsminst1/TSMfile02 </br> /tsminst1/TSMfile03 </br> and so on. |  | Minimum total space for all directories: <ul><li>Small: At least 38 TB</li><li>Medium: At least 180 TB</li><li>Large: At least 500 TB</li></ul> |  Create a minimum number of file systems for storage, depending on the size of your system: <ul><li>Small: At least 2 file systems</li><li>Medium: At least 10 file systems</li><li> Large: At least 30 file systems</li></ul> |
| Directories for database backup | /tsminst1/TSMbkup00 </br> /tsminst1/TSMbkup01 </br> /tsminst1/TSMbkup02 </br> /tsminst1/TSMbkup03 </br> and so on. |  | Minimum total space for all directories:<ul><li>Small: At least 3 TB</li><li>Medium: At least 10 TB</li><li>Large: At least 16 TB</li></ul> | Create a minimum number of file systems for backing up the database, depending on the size of your system:<ul><li>Small: At least 2 file systems</li><li>Medium: At least 3 file systems</li><li>Large: At least 3 file systems</li></ul> The first database backup directory is also used for the archive log failover directory and a second copy of the volume history and device configuration files. |


Use Table 7 when you run the Blueprint configuration script to configure the server. The preferred method is to use the default values, except where noted.

_Table 7. Values needed for the server configuration_

| Item      | Default value    | Your value  | Notes          |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Db2 instance owner ID | `tsminst1` |   | If you changed the value for the server instance directory in Table 6 from the default, modify the value for the Db2 instance owner ID as well. |
| Db2 instance owner password |  There is no default for this value. |   |  The user is required to select a value for the instance owner password. Ensure that you record this value in a secure location. 
| Primary group for the Db instance owner ID | `tsmsrvrs` |   |   |
| Server name | The default value for the server name is the system host name. |   |   | 
| Server password | There is no default for this value. |   |  The user is required to select a value for the server password. Ensure that you record this value in a secure location. |
| Administrator ID (user ID for the server instance) | `admin` |    |    |
| Administrator ID password | There is no default for this value. |   |  The user is required to select a value for the administrator password. Ensure that you record
this value in a secure location. |
| Schedule start time | 22:00  |   | The default schedule start time begins the client workload phase, which is predominantly the client backup and archive activities. During the client workload phase, server resources support client operations. These operations are usually completed during the nightly schedule window. </br> Schedules for server maintenance operations are defined to begin 10 hours after the start of the client backup window. |
