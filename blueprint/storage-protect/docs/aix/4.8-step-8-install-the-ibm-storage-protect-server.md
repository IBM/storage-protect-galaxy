Install the IBM Storage Protect server and license.

**About this task**

Although support for the Blueprint configuration script and container storage pools began with IBM Storage Protect Version 7.1.3, the preferred method is to install IBM Storage Protect V7.1.7 or a later level of V7, or V8.1.3 or later. In this way, you can obtain critical fixes and enable inline compression of data in container storage pools. To take advantage of the latest product updates, install the latest product level. At the time of publication, the latest available level was V8.1.22.

Before you install IBM Storage Protect, review the list of new features, including any security enhancements, for your selected release. For an overview, see [What's new in V8 releases](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-protect/8.1.22?topic=servers-whats-new).

For information about security updates, see [What you should know about security before you install or upgrade the server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-protect/8.1.22?topic=pisps-what-you-should-know-about-security-before-you-install-upgrade-server).
