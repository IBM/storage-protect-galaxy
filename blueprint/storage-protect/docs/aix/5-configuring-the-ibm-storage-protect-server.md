## Chapter 5. Configuring the IBM Storage Protect server

Run the Blueprint configuration script, `sp_config.pl`, to configure the IBM Storage Protect server.

**Before you begin**

You can run the Blueprint configuration script in interactive or non mode. In interactive mode, you provide responses for each step in the script and accept defaults or enter values for the configuration. In noninteractive mode, the script uses a response file that contains answers to the script prompts.

To run the script in noninteractive mode, use one of the response files that are included in the blueprint
configuration compressed file. For instructions about how to use a response file, see Appendix C, ["Using a response file with the Blueprint configuration script"](appendix-c-using-a-response-file-with-the-blueprint-configuration-script.md).

**About this task**

When you start the script and select the size of the server that you want to configure, the script verifies the following hardware and system configuration prerequisites:

* Sufficient memory is available for server operations.
* Processor core count meets blueprint specifications.
* Kernel parameters are set correctly. If the values are not set as specified, they are automatically updated when you run the Blueprint configuration script to configure the server. For more information about kernel parameter settings, see Table 20.
* All required file systems are created.
* The minimum number of file system types exist and the minimum level of free space is available in each file system.

If all prerequisites checks are passed, the script begins server configuration. The following tasks are completed to configure the server for optimal performance, based on the scale size that you select:
* A Db2 database instance is created.
* The dsmserv.opt options file with optimum values is created.
* The server database is formatted.
* The system configuration is updated to automatically start the server when the system starts.
* Definitions that are required for database backup operations are created.
* A directory-container storage pool with optimal performance settings for data deduplication is defined. </br>You can use the `-legacy` option with the blueprint configuration script to force the creation of a deduplicated storage pool, which uses a FILE device class.
* Policy domains for each type of client workload are defined.
* Schedules for client backup are created.
* Server maintenance schedules that are sequenced for optimal data deduplication scalability are created.
* The client options file is created.

The blueprint configuration script includes a compression option that enables compression for both the archive log and database backups. You can save significant storage space by using this option, but the amount of time that is needed to complete database backups increases. The preferred method is to enable the option if you are configuring a small blueprint system because limited space is configured for the archive log and database backups.

The default setting for the `compression` option is disabled.

**Tip**: Do not confuse the blueprint configuration script compression option with inline compression of data in container storage pools, which is enabled by default with IBM Storage Protect V7.1.5 and later. 

Complete the following steps as the root user to run the Blueprint configuration script.

**Procedure**

1. Open a terminal window.
1. If you did not extract the Blueprint configuration script compressed file to prepare file systems for IBM Storage Protect, follow the instructions in ["Configure a file system by using the script"](4.4.1-configure-a-file-system-by-using-the-script.md).
1. Change to the `tools` directory by issuing the following command:
   ```
    cd tools
   ```
1. Run the configuration script in one of the following modes:
   * To run the configuration script in interactive mode and enter your responses at the script prompts, issue the following command:
     ```
     perl sp_config.pl
     ```
     If you want to enable compression for the archive log and database backups on a small system, issue the following command:
     ```
     perl sp_config.pl -compression
     ```
     Depending on how you preconfigured the system, you can accept the default values that are presented by the script. Use the information that you recorded in the ["Planning worksheets"](2.2-planning-worksheets.md). If you changed any of the default values during the preconfiguration step, you must manually enter your values at the script prompts.

   * To run the configuration script in noninteractive mode by using a response file to set configuration values, specify the response file when you run the script. For example:
      * To use the default response file for a medium system, issue the following command:
        ```
        perl sp_config.pl ./response-files/responsefilemed_aix.txt
        ```
      * To use the default response file for a small system and enable compression for the archive log and database backups, issue the following command:
        ```
        perl sp_config.pl ./response-files/responsefilesmall_aix.txt -compression
        ```
      * To use the default response file for a system that uses IBM Elastic Storage System, issue the following command:
        ```
        perl sp_config.pl ./response-files/responsefile_ess.txt -skipmount
        ```
      If you encounter a problem during the configuration and want to pause temporarily, use the quit option. When you run the script again, it resumes at the point that you stopped. You can also open other terminal windows to correct any issues, and then return to and continue the script. When the script finishes successfully, a log file is created in the current directory.

1. Save the log file for future reference. </br>
   The log file is named `setupLog_<datestamp>.log` where `datestamp` is the date on which you ran the configuration script. If you run the script more than once on the same day, a version number is appended to the end of the name for each additional version that is saved. </br> For example, if you ran the script three times on July 27, 2013, the following logs are created:
   * setupLog_130727.log
   * setupLog_130727_1.log
   * setupLog_130727_2.log

**Results**

After the script finishes, the server is ready to use. Review Table 18 and the setup log file for details about your system configuration.
