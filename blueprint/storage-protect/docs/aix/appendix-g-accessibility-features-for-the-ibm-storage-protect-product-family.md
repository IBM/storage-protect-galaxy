## Appendix G. Accessibility features for the IBM Storage Protect product family

Accessibility features assist users who have a disability, such as restricted mobility or limited vision, to use information technology content successfully.

### Overview
The IBM Storage Protect family of products includes the following major accessibility features:
* Keyboard-only operation
* Operations that use a screen reader

The IBM Storage Protect family of products uses the latest W3C Standard, [WAI-ARIA 1.0](www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/), to ensure compliance with US Section 508 and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). To take advantage of accessibility features, use the latest release of your screen reader and the latest web browser that is supported by the product. 

The product documentation in IBM Documentation is enabled for accessibility.

### Keyboard navigation

This product uses standard navigation keys.

### Interface information

User interfaces do not have content that flashes 2 - 55 times per second.

Web user interfaces rely on cascading style sheets to render content properly and to provide a usable experience. The application provides an equivalent way for low-vision users to use system display settings, including high-contrast mode. You can control font size by using the device or web browser settings.

Web user interfaces include WAI-ARIA navigational landmarks that you can use to quickly navigate to functional areas in the application.

### Vendor software
The IBM Storage Protect product family includes certain vendor software that is not covered under the IBM license agreement. IBM makes no representation about the accessibility features of these products. Contact the vendor for accessibility information about its products.
