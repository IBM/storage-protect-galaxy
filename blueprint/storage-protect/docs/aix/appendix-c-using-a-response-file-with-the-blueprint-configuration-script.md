## Appendix C. Using a response file with the Blueprint configuration script

You can run the Blueprint configuration script in non-interactive mode by using a response file to set your
configuration choices.

Three response files are provided with the Blueprint configuration script. If you plan to setup a system by
using all default values, you can run the configuration script in non-interactive mode by using one of the
following response files:
* **Small system**
  * ./response-files/responsefilesmall_aix.txt
* **Medium system**
  * ./response-files/responsefilemed_aix.txt
* **Large system**
  * ./response-files/responsefilelarge_aix.txt

The files are pre-filled with default configuration values for the small, medium, and large systems and do not require updates.

If you want to customize your responses for a system, use the following table with your ["Planning worksheets"](2.2-planning-worksheets.md) to update one of the default response files. The values that are used in the response file correspond to values that you recorded in the _Your value_ column of the worksheet.

_Table 24. Response field descriptions_

| Response file value | Corresponding value from the planning worksheet |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| serverscale         | Not recorded in the planning worksheet. Enter a value of S for a small system, M for a medium system, or L for a large system. |
