## Chapter 4. Setting up the system

##### Configure a file system by using the script

To use the configuration script, `storage_prep_aix.pl`, extract the Blueprint configuration script package and then run the script.

**Procedure**

1. Open a terminal window and change to the directory where you downloaded the `sp-config_v51.tar.gz` file.
1. Extract the file by issuing the following commands:
   ```
   gzip -d sp-config_v51.tar.gz
   tar -xvf sp-config_v51.tar
   ```
   The process creates a directory that is called `sp-config`. This directory contains the storage preparation script, the workload simulation tool, and the Blueprint configuration script.
1. Change to the `sp-config` directory by issuing the following command:
   ```
   cd sp-config
   ```
1. Run the Perl script and specify the size of system that you are configuring. </br>For example, for a medium system, issue the following command:
   ```
   perl storage_prep_aix.pl medium
   ```
   If you did not map the disks to the host according to the specifications in "Step 3: IBM FlashSystem Storage: Configure multipath I/O", the script requires customization.
1. List all file systems by issuing the df command. </br>Verify that file systems are mounted at the correct LUN and mount point. Also, verify the available
    space. The amount of used space should be approximately 1%. </br> For example:
   ```
   tapsrv07> df -g /tsminst1/*
   Filesystem     GB blocks   Free     %Used    Iused    %Iused   Mounted on
   /dev/tsmact00  195.12      194.59   1%       4        1%       /tsminst1/TSMalog
   ```
