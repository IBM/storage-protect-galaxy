### 3.4 IBM Elastic Storage System

IBM Elastic Storage System is a scalable storage system that provides a clustered IBM Spectrum Scale file system that is suitable for being shared by several IBM Spectrum Protect servers. By following the instructions, you can configure a large system that uses IBM Elastic Storage System model 5000 SL6 for the directory container storage pool, and the flash storage in the IBM Elastic Storage System model 3200 for database storage. 

#### 3.4.1 Storage configuration

Some configuration steps are completed at the factory and by IBM services so that the system will be ready for you to provision storage as single file systems from each disk system to be shared by multiple IBM Spectrum Protect servers. These configuration steps include hardware installation and cabling, software installation on the storage nodes, and configuration of the IBM Elastic Storage System cluster and recovery groups.

#### 3.4.2 Large system layout

Figure 5 shows an optional system layout with a single IBM Elastic Storage System providing sufficient storage for four IBM Spectrum Protect servers to share. Each server protects a different set of clients. Clients communicate with an IBM Spectrum Protect server by using 25 Gb Ethernet connections.

The IBM Spectrum Protect servers communicate with the IBM Elastic Storage System system by using 100 Gb Infiniband connections. The IBM Spectrum Scale client is installed on each IBM Spectrum Protect server. High-speed access to the storage is possible by using the network shared disk (NSD) protocol that provides direct access to the IBM Elastic Storage System system through the Ethernet network.
