### Step 6: Test system performance

Before you install the IBM Storage Protect server and client, use the [Disk Workload Simulation Tool](/tools/sp-load-generator/docs/disk-workload-simulator.md), to identify performance issues with your hardware setup and configuration.

**What to do next**

Compare your performance results against test lab results by reviewing sample outputs for storage pool
and database workloads on both medium and large systems:

* For the storage pool workload, the measurement for average combined throughput in MB per second combines the read and write throughput. This is the most useful value when you compare results.
* For the database workload, the peak IOPS measurements add the peak read and write operations per second for a specific time interval. This is the most useful value when you compare results for the database workload.

To review the sample outputs, see Appendix A, ["Performance results"](appendix-a-performance-results.md).
