## Chapter 5. Configuring the IBM Storage Protect server

### 5.1 Removing an IBM Storage Protect blueprint configuration

If your blueprint configuration fails, you can use a cleanup script to remove the IBM Storage Protect server and stored data.

**Before you begin**

> Attention: The automated script `sp_cleanup.pl` is destructive and will completely remove an IBM Storage Protect server and all stored data.

**About this task**

The script can be used to clean up your system during initial testing and troubleshooting for blueprint configurations. If a configuration attempt fails, running the script removes the server and all associated IBM Storage Protect data. The script uses the file, `serversetupstatefileforcleanup.txt`, which is generated when you run the Blueprint configuration script, `sp_config.pl`. 

**Procedure**

To clean up your system by using the script, complete the following steps:

1. Edit the `sp_cleanup.pl` script by commenting out the exit on the first line. </br>For example:
   ```
    #exit; # This script is destructive, so by default it exits. Comment-out this line to proceed.
   ```
1. Copy the `sp_cleanup.pl` script into the folder where the `sp_config.pl` script is located. </br>Run the following command:
   ```
    perl sp_cleanup.pl
   ```
1. Run `perl sp_cleanup.pl`
