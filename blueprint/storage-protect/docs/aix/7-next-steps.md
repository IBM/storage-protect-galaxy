## Chapter 7. Next steps

After you complete the setup and configuration for your IBM Storage Protect implementation, you can monitor your system and plan for maintenance.

* **Monitor your system with the IBM Storage Protect Operations Center** </br>For more information about the Operations Center, see the following topics.
  * **Getting started with the Operations Center** </br> [Installing and upgrading the Operations Center](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-protect/8.1.22?topic=upgrading-installing-operations-center)
  * **Monitoring with the Operations Center** </br>[Monitoring storage solutions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-protect/8.1.22?topic=servers-monitoring-storage-solutions)
* **Access the administrative command-line client**</br>The administrative command-line client is installed when you setup your system to run the IBM
Storage Protect Blueprint configuration script. You can use the administrative client to issue server commands. </br> For more information about using the DSMADMC command to start and stop the administrative client, see [Issuing commands from the administrative client](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-protect/8.1.22?topic=line-issuing-commands-from-administrative-client).
